    <h2 <b><u> Service with a Smile</u></h2>
    <p>In the restaurant industry, good service means a friendly, welcoming service.</p>
    <p> A restaurant owner should not merely strive to avoid bad service, but she should positively </p>
    <p>strive to encourage the exceptional service that occurs when service workers take a genuine </p>
    <p>interest in their customers.</p>


    <h2 <b><u>Being Available</u></h2>
    <p>Sometimes, good customer service simply means being available. Customers who can see managers, </p>
    <p>hosts and waitstaff are more likely to give employees the opportunity to provide good customer</p>
    <p> service by making requests. Many diners are hesitant to actually walk into the bar or
    <p>to ask for something, and a customer should never have to shout into the kitchen. </p>
    <p>Just by being visible, you make customers feel they are having a better experience </p>
    <p>because they know if they need something, you're right there, available to help.</p>

    <h2>Being Exceptional</h2>
    <p>Customers can get good food and decent customer service almost anywhere. </p>
    <p>What will set your restaurant apart is the degree to which you are willing </p>
    <p>to go above and beyond to be exceptional. Restaurant employees can practice </p>
    <p>this kind of customer service by being willing to make special creations for guests</p>,
    <p>offering them drinks to go, bringing mints after dinner and engaging in other little</p>
    <p> practices that show they are going above and beyond the competition.</p>
